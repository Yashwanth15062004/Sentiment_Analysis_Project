# Victory Cheers to Defeat Tears
The central objective of this project is to conduct hypothesis testing to 
systematically examine or challenge, the assertion that there has been a 
noticeable alteration in the sentiment and opinion of the Indian 
population towards the Indian cricket team or cricket in general following 
the recent World Cup loss. 
 
This study employs hypothesis testing techniques within the framework of 
Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically VADER sentiment 
analysis as discussed in class, to analyze comments extracted from viral 
social media posts and videos related to the World Cup and the Indian 
cricket team.
